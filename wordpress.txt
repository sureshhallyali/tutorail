Theme Install in WordPress on localhost
     a theme is a collection of templates and stylesheets used to define the appearance and
     display of a WordPress powered website. 
     They can be changed, managed, and added from the WordPress admin area under 
     Appearance » Themes. ... WordPress.org has a large collection of free ones in their Themes Directory.
     The theme is the design of our whole website while the template is the layout of a single page of your site.

 	A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. 
	They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites.
